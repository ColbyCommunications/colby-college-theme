    text: "<p>In 1818, Colby’s early faculty and students sailed up the Kennebec on the sloop Hero to start a college, far north of the established centers of higher learning. Many daring moves followed as Colby grew, struggled, and prospered. Today, the spirit of the Hero’s voyage guides our students, faculty, alumni, and staff to continue to dare northward, challenge themselves, and make an impact on the world.</p><p>Dare Northward leverages our existing strengths to enhance our student’s experiences, improve their outcomes, and produce generations of leaders to tackle the world’s greatest challenges.</p>",
